strategists...A marketing 
 dedicated to helping  your business grow.
    </h1>
    <p> We began our journey in 1919 with just four dedicated employees and we’ve grown to over 130 employees today by using the same successful methods we employ for our customers. Our mission is quite simple: help your business grow through effective digital marketing. At Mainstreethost, we live and breathe digital marketing, and in an industry that is constantly shifting and changing shape, it’s our business to stay ahead of the changes. Our team operates by learning, educating, innovating, creating, and above all, delivering results. If we can do it for our own business, we can do it for yours, too.

  <h1>When you succeed,
    We succeed.</h1>
    <p>“In a crowded and ever-changing industry, we make it a priority to stay ahead of the game. Led by a phenomenal management staff, we’re always educating ourselves, keeping up with the trends, and adding new services that we believe will assist in our clients’ growth. We also don’t stop where a lot of agencies might. The end goal is customer success and we’re not satisfied until that success is reached: even if it requires extra time and resources on our end. I’m a firm believer that the success of our clients is truly our success; we’d be nowhere without them. My family and I have invested in the life and longevity of this company. We have a backbone 130-strong and that number continues to grow. The accelerated growth we’ve witnessed, even the last few years, has been tremendous, and we’re really excited for what the future holds.”
